# Scoping Review for TerminoDiff

To get an overview of the literature, we performed a scoping review.

![PRISMA flowchart](assets/prisma-terminodiff.png)

Our PICOC are:
- Population = Terminology Tooling
- Intervention = Differences in resource versions
- Comparison = GNU `diff`
- Outcome = Changes made visible and understandable
- Context = healthcare informatics.

We derived the following search string from the PICOC:

```
("fhir" OR "ontology" OR "rdf" OR "terminology") AND ("diff" OR "change" OR "difference" OR "version")
```

We queried the following sources:

- PubMed
- Scopus
- Springer Link
- other (we added sources that were referenced in other literature to this group)

Our inclusion and exclusion criteria are:

| Inclusion                                            | Exclusion                                                           |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Does the approach consider HL7 FHIR resources?       | No free-text available                                              |
| Does the approach consider terminological artefacts? | The approach does not consider terminological/ontological artefacts |
| The approach computes a diff                         | The approach is not from the medical domain                         |

By querying the three sources using the search string, and adding references to the "other" category, we selected 25 studies in total (Scopus 12, Springer Link 4, PubMed 3, other 6), based on their abstracts.

After abstract selection, we screened the papers using the following screening questions:

- Applicability to this work?
- Does the approach consider the representation and maintenance of terminological/ontological artefacts?

After screening, we selected the following six works as applicable:

We then extracted the following data from the referenced literature:

- What is the underlying terminological model? (select from FHIR, RDF/OWL, other)
- Is the result visualized in some fashion? (Boolean)
- Is a graph being generated? (Boolean)
- Mapping from one version to another? (Boolean)
- Comments (Free-text)
